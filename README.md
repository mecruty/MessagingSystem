# Digital Post Office 

### Description

A regular post office stores letters so people can send and receive mail.

This would be a digital post office, consisting of a central system where, one user at a time, could create an account, login, receive messages, and send messages to other accounts.

### Uses

- To share messages without internet.
- As a post office where mail lasts indefinitely.
- In a more magical world, maybe as a secret system, where spies could exchange messages without ever meeting.


### Personal Interest

I like this idea because there are many more possibilites that could be added onto the basic idea. For example, accounts could be password protected, there could be notifications for unread messages, there could be anonymous messages, *etc...*

## User Stories

- As a user, I want to be able to add a message to continue a particular conversation.
- As a user, I want to be able to receive messages and view a past conversation.
- As a user, I want to be able to set a password to my account.
- As a user, I want to be able to delete my messages.
